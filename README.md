# Machine-Learning
DeepChess is an AI using a deep learning heuritic. Using chess games data, this model was train with thousands of professional games. This heuritic is used in the MiniMax algorithm.


I also train some models on python with the Mnist digits dataset


## DeepChess
To create the dataset used by create_model.py : use ./createData "elo", where elo is the minimum elo of games used in the dataset (max : 3300)
To play against the AI : ./mlapp
